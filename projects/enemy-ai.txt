Title:
Enemy AI Behavioral System

Description:
A gameplay intelligence stack for Unreal Engine that combines sensory logic, behavior trees, and adaptive reaction loops.

Project Metrics:

 - Engine:
	UE5
 - Core:
	Behavior Trees
 - Outcome:
	Adaptive Combat

Body 1: <Title: Sensory Architecture>
Modeled sensory channels for line-of-sight, aggression triggers, and retreat logic. Enemies perceive the environment through layered awareness systems that respond to sound, visibility, and threat proximity.

Body 2: <Title: Behavior Tree Design>
Implemented behavior tree branches to make enemy intent more legible to players. Each decision node evaluates context — health, ammo, player distance — creating emergent tactical choices.

Body 3: <Title: Tuning & Balancing>
Tested tuning profiles for pacing, pressure curves, and difficulty fairness. Iterative playtesting sessions refined the balance between challenge and frustration.

Tools used:
UE5, C++, Blueprints, Behavior Trees, AI Agents
